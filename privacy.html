                    <h6>Legal basis of processing</h6>
                    <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some
                            legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to
                            such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following
                            legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is
                            subject to European data protection law;</li>
                        <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for
                            any pre-contractual obligations thereof;</li>
                        <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is
                            subject;</li>
                        <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the
                            exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;</li>
                        <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or
                            by a third party.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
                        processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
                        contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

                        involved in the processing are located.</p>

                    <p>Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a
                        country other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred
                        Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.</p>
                    <p>Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the
                        European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set
                        up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner
                        to safeguard their Data.</p>

                    <p>If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of

                        <li>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has
                            given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the
                            Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so
                            for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to

                        order to revoke these permissions, Users may refer to the device settings or contact the Owner
                        for support at the contact details provided in the present document.</p>
                    <p>The exact procedure for controlling app permissions may be dependent on the User's device and
